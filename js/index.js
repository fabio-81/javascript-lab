//EXERCISE 1: The Fortune Teller
//Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself? Store the following into variables: job title, geographic location, annual salary, company name. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, making $N for Z."

let jobTitle = "Doctor";
let geographicLocation = "Japan";
let annualSalary = 100000;
let companyName = "Damaz";
//output to console
console.log(`You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, making $${annualSalary} for ${companyName}`);
//find an element
document.querySelector('#ex1')
//output to document
let ex1output = document.querySelector('#ex1')
ex1output.textContent = `You will be a ${jobTitle} in ${geographicLocation}, making $${annualSalary} for ${companyName}`


//EXERCISE 2: The Age Calculator
//Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it! Store the current year in a variable. Store their birth year in a variable. Calculate their age based on the stored values. Output them to the screen like so: "They are NN years old.", substituting the values.

let currentYear = 2020;

let birthYear = 1965;
console.log(`They are ${currentYear - birthYear} years old`);

document.querySelector('#ex2');
let ex2output = document.querySelector('#ex2');
ex2output.textContent = `They are ${currentYear - birthYear} years old`

//EXERCISE 3: The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more! Store your current age into a variable. Store a maximum age into a variable. Store an estimated amount per day (as a number). Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life. Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

let currentAge = 30;
let maximumAge = 100;
let ammountPerDay = 2;

console.log(`you will need ${(ammountPerDay * 365) * (maximumAge - currentAge)} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maximumAge}`);

document.querySelector('#ex3');
let ex3output = document.querySelector('#ex3');
ex3output.textContent = `you will need ${(ammountPerDay * 365) * (maximumAge - currentAge)} to last you until the ripe old age of ${maximumAge}`;

//EXERCISE 4: The Geometrizer
//Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here. Store a radius into a variable. Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN". Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

let circleRadius = 5;
let pi = 3.14;
console.log(`The circumference is ${2 * (pi * circleRadius)} and the area is ${pi * (circleRadius**2)}`);

document.querySelector('#ex4')
let ex4output = document.querySelector('#ex4')
ex4output.textContent = `The circumference is ${2 * (pi * circleRadius)} and the area is ${pi * (circleRadius**2)}`



//EXERCISE 5: The Temperature Converter
//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here. Store a celsius temperature into a variable. Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".  Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable. Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."

let celsiusTemp = 30;
let farenheitTemp = 86;
console.log(`${celsiusTemp}C is ${celsiusTemp * (9/5) + 32}F and ${farenheitTemp}F is ${(farenheitTemp - 32) * (5/9)}C`);



document.querySelector('#ex5');
let ex5output = document.querySelector('#ex5');
ex5output.textContent = `${celsiusTemp}C is ${celsiusTemp * (9/5) + 32}F and ${farenheitTemp}F is ${(farenheitTemp - 32) * (5/9)}C`
